                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>Naruto is a Japanese manga series that follows the life and adventures of a young shinobi-to-be Naruto. Struggling to find his place in society due to his unusual and tragic past, in which he lost both of his parrents while still a baby, his desire to be reckognized by all other in the village is the main drive that pushes him forwards into prooving himself to others. The manga was later adapted into an anime series that enjoyed a large success both home and abroad and spawned numerous stand-alone movies from the original source material. To this day, Naruto is considered as one of the most impactful mangas/anime in the world by many.</p>
                <h3>Main characters</h3>
                <p>Even though Naruto has a plethora of characters that play significant role in the evolving storyline, the ones that we can come to a common understanding and separate them as true main characters are: Naruto Uzumaki, the titular hero, Sasuke Uchiha, a young, mysterious and moody boy who is the sole survivor of the famous Uchiha Clan, and Sakura Haruno, a young kunoichi (female ninja) who is the third member of Team 7 being composed of these three characters. Sakura has an immense crush on Sasuke and is willing to do anything to get his attention, which often fails.</p>
                <p>One other member of the Team 7 trio is their mentor Kakashi Hatake, a.k.a The Copy Ninja. Although his outwardly appearance and posture may portray him as a laid-back and lazy shinobi, he always provides assistance, support and thorough training to his pupils whenever they need it.</p>
                <h3>Story arcs</h3>
